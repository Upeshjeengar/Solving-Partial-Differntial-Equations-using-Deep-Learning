## 2. Solving the Wave Equation with Deep Learning Based Method
see [wave_equation.ipynb](https://github.com/Upeshjeengar/Deep-learning-Methods-in-Fluid-Dynamics/blob/main/wave_equation.ipynb)
This project solves the wave equation:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}
$$

where $c = 1$, and the initial conditions are given by:

$$
u(x, 0) = \phi(x) = \sin(x), \quad u_t(x, 0) = \psi(x) = \cos(x)
$$

The boundary conditions are:

$$
u(0,t) = 0 = u(L,t)
$$

### Exact Solution

The exact solution for this problem is expressed as an infinite Fourier series:

$$
u(x,t) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \sin\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right) \left( A_n \cos\left(\frac{n\pi t}{L}\right) + B_n \sin\left(\frac{n\pi t}{L}\right) \right)
$$

#### Coefficients:

The coefficients $A_n$ and $B_n$ are determined using the initial conditions. They are given by:

$$
A_n = \frac{2}{L} \int_0^L \sin(x) \sin\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right) dx
$$

$$
B_n = \frac{2}{n\pi L} \int_0^L \cos(x) \sin\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right) dx
$$
